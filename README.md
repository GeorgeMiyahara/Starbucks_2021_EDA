 Coffee is a must-have for many of us to start our day, and Starbucks is a well-known company that has dominated the coffee market since it was established in March 1971. Their popularity is evident everywhere you go, thanks to their high-quality coffee. In this analysis, we aim to investigate what has led to the explosion of Starbucks' popularity. Is it because they have more locations where more people live, or is it due to a particular age group? To unravel this fascinating mystery, we will examine the data in the 'Starbucks Locations Worldwide 2021' version.
